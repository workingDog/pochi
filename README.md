**Pochi** allows a presenter with an iPad or iPhone to share a presentation with a number of other viewer devices. 
As the presenter flips through the presentation pages, the viewers instantly receive the updated pages.

**Pochi** is really two applications, one is the **presenter** App and the other is the **viewer** App.

With the **presenter** App, a presenter selects a presentation from the device files folder, iCloud, DropBox or other storage, 
and press the **Start** button. The **viewer** App is then shown that presentation name for viewers to select.

## The presenter App

A presentation can be created using tools such as Apple Pages or Microsoft PowerPoint.
The presentation must be saved as a PDF document for **pochi** to use.
In addition a photo with format png, jpg, gif or tif can also be loaded individually. 
With a presentation selected, pressing the **Start** button will display the presentation 
and broadcast its presence to the **viewers**.

A presentation name with a gray background indicates the selected presentation. To deselect a 
presentation simply tap the selection again.

When no presentation is selected and the **Start** button is pressed, **pochi** will display a 
collection of whiteboards for the presenter to draw on.
