# The Presenter mode

![presenter](images/presenter1.png)

A presentation can be created using a number of tools such as *Apple Keynote, Pages or Preview*, *Microsoft PowerPoint* or 
*Adobe PDF tools*.
That presentation must be saved as a PDF document for **Pochi Presenter** to use.
A presentation can optionally require a password. When a password is set, the **Viewers** will be asked 
for that password in order to view the presentation. The communication between the **Presenter**
and the **Viewers** is made secure in this case.

To select a presentation press the **Presentation** button and navigate to the document you want. 
Once a PDF document is selected the presentation will be displayed and will broadcast 
its presence to the audience **Pochi Presentation** Apps using the local *Wi-Fi* network.

and the thumbnail pages, however swiping left and right to change page remains active.
