**Pochi** allows a presenter with an iPad, iPhone or a Mac to share a presentation with other iPads, iPhones and Macs in the audience.

# The Presenter App

![presenter](images/presenter1.png)

A presentation can be created using a number of tools such as *Apple Keynote, Pages or Preview*, *Microsoft PowerPoint* or 
*Adobe PDF tools*.
That presentation must be saved as a PDF document for **Pochi Presenter** to use.
In addition photos with format *png, jpg, jpeg, gif or tif* can also be loaded individually. 
A presentation can optionally require a password. When a password is set, **Viewers** will be asked 
for that password in order to view the presentation. The communication between the **Presenter**
and the **Viewers** is made secure in this case.

To select a presentation press the **Presentation** button and navigate to the document you want. 
Once a PDF document is selected the presentation will be displayed and will broadcast 
its presence to the **Pochi Viewer** Apps using the local *Wi-Fi* network.

and the thumbnail pages, however swiping left and right to change page remains active.

# The Viewer App

but it is not shown in the list, try pressing the **Refresh** button.
