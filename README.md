**Pochi** allows a presenter with an iPad or iPhone to share a presentation with other iPads and iPhones in the audience. 
As the presenter flips through the presentation pages, the viewer devices instantly and securely receive the updated pages.

**Pochi** is really two applications talking to each other, one is the **Pochi Presenter** App and the other is the **Pochi Viewer** App.
The **Pochi Presenter** App is used by presenters to share and interact with their presentation, and 
the **Pochi Viewer** App is used by the audience to view the presentation.
Both Apps need to be connected to the same local *Wi-Fi* network to work with each other.

With the **Pochi Presenter** App, 
a presenter selects a presentation from the device *Files folder, iCloud, Dropbox* or other storage, 
and press the **Start** button. The **Pochi Viewer** App is then able to follow that presentation 
by selecting it from a list.

The **Pochi Viewer** App is *free* and will soon be available from the [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id375380948?mt=8).
The **Pochi Viewer** App includes a trial *Presenter* function that is disabled after *7 days*.

The **Pochi Presenter** App cost **USD $4.99** and will soon be available from the [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id375380948?mt=8).
The **Pochi Presenter** App includes the **Pochi Viewer** App.

# The Presenter App

![presenter](images/presenter1.png)

A presentation can be created using a number of tools such as *Apple Keynote, Pages or Preview*, *Microsoft PowerPoint* or 
*Adobe PDF tools*.
That presentation must be saved as a PDF document for **Pochi Presenter** to use.
In addition photos with format *png, jpg, jpeg, gif or tif* can also be loaded individually. 
A presentation can optionally require a password. When a password is set, *Viewers* will be asked 
for that password in order to view the presentation. The communication between the *Presenter* 
and the *Viewers* are made secure in this case.

A presentation name with a gray background indicates the presentation is selected. 
To deselect a presentation simply tap the selection again. 

With a presentation selected, pressing the **Start** button will display the presentation 
and broadcast its presence to the **Pochi Viewer** Apps using the local *Wi-Fi* network.

Different pages can be selected using the thumbnail bar or by swiping left and right.
 
A presentation can be annotated using the drawing tool provided after pressing the draw tool icon.

When no presentation is selected and the **Start** button is pressed, **Pochi Presenter** will display a 
collection of empty whiteboards for the presenter to draw on using the drawing tool. The boards 
consist of 3 whiteboards, 3 chalkboards and 3 blackboards.

When not in drawing mode, tapping on the presentation or whiteboard will hide or show the navigation bar 
and the thumbnail pages, however swiping left and right to change page remains active.

# The Viewer App

The **Pochi Viewer** App receives the presentation initiated by the **Pochi Presenter** App, it is used to passively view the presentation. 

The main page of the **Pochi Viewer** App shows a list of active presentations. 
The user selects the presentation to follow by tapping on the desired presentation name.

It takes a few seconds for a presentation to appear in the list. If a presentation is expected, 
but it is not shown in the list, try pressing the **Refresh** button.
 
![viewer](images/viewer1.png)

Once a presentation is selected, the current page will be displayed and the App will download the full presentation in the background. 
The number of pages downloaded to date is displayed next to the presentation name. 
When all pages have been downloaded, only the title name will be displayed.
 
![viewer](images/viewer2.png)

The **Pochi Viewer** App also allows for printing, saving and sharing of the presentation by pressing 
the **share** button. Note that these functions will use the current number of pages downloaded to date.
