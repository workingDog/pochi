                <h1 id="the-presenter-app">The Presenter mode</h1>

                <p><img src="/pochi/images/presenter1.png" alt="presenter" /></p>

                <p>A presentation can be created using a number of tools such as <em>Apple Keynote, Pages or Preview</em>, <em>Microsoft PowerPoint</em> or
                <em>Adobe PDF tools</em>.
                That presentation must be saved as a PDF document for <strong>Pochi Presenter</strong> to use.
                A presentation can optionally require a password. When a password is set, <strong>Viewers</strong> will be asked
                for that password in order to view the presentation. The communication between the <strong>Presenter</strong>
                and the <strong>Viewers</strong> is made secure in this case.</p>

                <p>To select a presentation press the <strong>Presentation</strong> button and navigate to the document you want.
                Once a PDF document is selected the presentation will be displayed and will broadcast
                its presence to the audience <strong>Pochi Presenter</strong> Apps using the local <em>Wi-Fi</em> network.</p>

                <p><img src="/pochi/images/presenter2.png" alt="presenter" /></p>

                <p>Different pages can be selected using the thumbnail bar or by swiping left and right.</p>

                <p>A presentation can be annotated using the drawing tool provided by pressing the draw tool icon.</p>

                <p><img src="/pochi/images/presenter3.png" alt="presenter" /></p>

                <p>When the <strong>Whiteboard</strong> button is pressed, <strong>Pochi Presenter</strong> will display a
                collection of empty whiteboards for the presenter to draw on using the drawing tool. The boards
                consist of 3 whiteboards, 3 chalkboards and 3 blackboards.</p>

                <p><img src="/pochi/images/presenter4.png" alt="presenter" /></p>

                <p>When not in drawing mode, tapping on the presentation or whiteboard will hide or show the navigation bar
                and the thumbnail pages, however swiping left and right to change page remains active.</p>

                <h1 id="the-viewer-app">The Viewer mode</h1>

                <p>The App <strong>Viewer</strong> mode receives the presentation initiated by the <strong>Pochi Presenter</strong> App, it is used to passively view the presentation.</p>

                <p>The main page of the <strong>Viewer</strong> mode shows a list of active presentations.
                The user selects the presentation to follow by tapping on the desired presentation name.</p>

                <p>It takes a few seconds for a presentation to appear in the list. If a presentation is expected,
                but it is not shown in the list, try pressing the <strong>Refresh</strong> button.</p>

                <p><img src="/pochi/images/viewer1.png" alt="viewer" /></p>

                <p>Once a presentation is selected, the current page will be displayed and the App will download the full presentation in the background.
                The number of pages downloaded to date is displayed next to the presentation name.
                When all pages have been downloaded, only the title name will be displayed.</p>

                <p><img src="/pochi/images/viewer2.png" alt="viewer" /></p>

                <p>The App <strong>Viewer</strong> mode also allows for printing, saving and sharing of the presentation by pressing
                the <strong>share</strong> button. Note that these functions will use the current number of pages downloaded to date.</p>
