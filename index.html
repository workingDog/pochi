<p><strong>Pochi</strong> allows a presenter with an iPad, iPhone or a Mac to share a presentation with other iPads, iPhones and Macs in the audience. 
As the presenter flips through the presentation pages, the viewer devices instantly and securely receive the updated pages.</p>

<p><strong>Pochi</strong> is really two applications talking to each other, one is the <strong>Pochi Presenter</strong> App and the other is the free <strong>Pochi Viewer</strong> App.
The <strong>Pochi Presenter</strong> App is used by presenters to share and interact with their presentation, and 
the <strong>Pochi Viewer</strong> App is used by the audience to view the presentation.
Both Apps need to be connected to the same local <em>Wi-Fi</em> network to work with each other.</p>

<p>With the <strong>Pochi Presenter</strong> App, 
a presenter starts by selecting a presentation document from the device <em>Files folder, iCloud Drive, Dropbox</em> or other storage. The <strong>Pochi Viewer</strong> App is then able to follow that presentation
by selecting it from a list.</p>

                <p><img src="/pochi/images/presenter1.png" alt="presenter" /></p>

                <p>A presentation can be created using a number of tools such as <em>Apple Keynote, Pages or Preview</em>, <em>Microsoft PowerPoint</em> or
                <em>Adobe PDF tools</em>.
                That presentation must be saved as a PDF document for <strong>Pochi Presenter</strong> to use.
                In addition photos with format <em>png, jpg, jpeg, gif or tif</em> can also be loaded individually.
                A presentation can optionally require a password. When a password is set, <strong>Viewers</strong> will be asked
                for that password in order to view the presentation. The communication between the <strong>Presenter</strong>
                and the <strong>Viewers</strong> is made secure in this case.</p>

                <p>To select a presentation press the <strong>Presentation</strong> button and navigate to the document you want.
                Once a PDF document is selected the presentation will be displayed and will broadcast
                its presence to the <strong>Pochi Viewer</strong> Apps using the local <em>Wi-Fi</em> network.</p>

                <p><img src="/pochi/images/presenter2.png" alt="presenter" /></p>

                <p>Different pages can be selected using the thumbnail bar or by swiping left and right.</p>

                <p>A presentation can be annotated using the drawing tool provided after pressing the draw tool icon.</p>

                <p><img src="/pochi/images/presenter3.png" alt="presenter" /></p>

                <p>When the <strong>Whiteboard</strong> button is pressed, <strong>Pochi Presenter</strong> will display a
                collection of empty whiteboards for the presenter to draw on using the drawing tool. The boards
                consist of 3 whiteboards, 3 chalkboards and 3 blackboards.</p>

                <p><img src="/pochi/images/presenter4.png" alt="presenter" /></p>

                <p>When not in drawing mode, tapping on the presentation or whiteboard will hide or show the navigation bar
                and the thumbnail pages, however swiping left and right to change page remains active.</p>

                <h1 id="the-viewer-app">The Pochi Viewer App</h1>

                <p>The <strong>Pochi Viewer</strong> App receives the presentation initiated by the <strong>Pochi Presenter</strong> App, it is used to passively view the presentation.</p>

                <p>The main page of the <strong>Pochi Viewer</strong> App shows a list of active presentations.
                The user selects the presentation to follow by tapping on the desired presentation name.</p>

                <p>It takes a few seconds for a presentation to appear in the list. If a presentation is expected,
                but it is not shown in the list, try pressing the <strong>Refresh</strong> button.</p>

                <p><img src="/pochi/images/viewer1.png" alt="viewer" /></p>

                <p>Once a presentation is selected, the current page will be displayed and the App will download the full presentation in the background.
                The number of pages downloaded to date is displayed next to the presentation name.
                When all pages have been downloaded, only the title name will be displayed.</p>

                <p><img src="/pochi/images/viewer2.png" alt="viewer" /></p>

                <p>The <strong>Pochi Viewer</strong> App also allows for printing, saving and sharing of the presentation by pressing
                the <strong>share</strong> button. Note that these functions will use the current number of pages downloaded to date.</p>
